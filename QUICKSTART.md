## What It Does

This is a **pure journal website** for documenting your daily ML work:

- ✍️ Write entries about what you built/learned
- 🏷️ Categorize by topic (Transformers, LLMs, RL, etc.)
- 📱 Responsive on all devices
- 🎯 No planning/todo features - just work documentation

## No Planning Content

The site is intentionally simple:
- ❌ No daily routine schedule displayed
- ❌ No to-do lists or planning sections
- ❌ No "what I will do" sections
- ✅ Only "what I did" documentation

## Ready for Production

Once you deploy to Vercel with your `asif-reh.me` domain:
- Automatic deployment on every GitHub push
- Lightning-fast global CDN
- No downtime deployments
- Free HTTPS

**Everything is set up. Just deploy to Vercel and start journaling!**
